# Game-Hub
This is a GameHub built in Java using JavaFx for the GUI. I did this with a group and my portion is HangMan and Dodger. (You do need to have JavaFx installed to run this.)

# Installation

1.) Make sure you have the Elcipse IDE installed.

    (I am assuming you have Java installed already.)

2.) Use the marketplace to install JavaFx.


3.) Clone the repository and import it into Eclipse.

# Running

1.) Once you have installed the JavaFx plugin and imported the project into Eclipse, run the GameHub.java file.
